Projects to get you hands dirty with data !

# Project 1: Death Cause Analysis
Description : The idea is to go over deaths statistics across USA(per state, per cause) for the years 1999-2015 and glean whatever inference possible.

Conclusion : As the data points were minimal , no statistically significant conclusions were made.

Learning : Plotting dataframes, qqplot, minimum sample size required to warrant normality of sample mean etc.

# Project 2: Teen Birth RateAnalysis
Description : The idea is to go over teen birth rate statistics across USA(per state, per county) for the years 2003-2015 and glean whatever inference possible.

Conclusion : As the data points were minimal , no statistically significant conclusions were made.

Learning : Plotting dataframes, qqplot, minimum sample size required to warrant normality of sample mean etc.

# Project 3: Obesity Analysis
Description : The idea is to go over obesity statistics across USA(per state) for the years 2011-2016 and glean whatever inference possible.

Conclusion : As the data points were minimal , no statistically significant conclusions were made.

Learning : Plotting dataframes, qqplot, minimum sample size required to warrant normality of sample mean etc.
